# Traing problems for CUMCM

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/Xiaozhu-Zhang1998/CUMCM/blob/master/CUMCM.jpg">

Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling ([CUMCM](http://en.mcm.edu.cn/index_en.html)) is one of the biggest applied math contests for undergraduates in China. I joined the training team for CUMCM at Hunan University in summer 2018 and accomplished several training problems/ projects. Later that year, my team won the national first prize in the official contest. Here I post those problems for the sake of collection and sharing.
