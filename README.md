# Traing problems for CUMCM

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/Xiaozhu-Zhang1998/CUMCM/blob/master/CUMCM.jpg">

Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling ([CUMCM](http://en.mcm.edu.cn/index_en.html)) is one of the biggest applied math contests for undergraduates in China. I joined the training team for CUMCM at Hunan University in summer 2018 and accomplished several training problems/ projects. Later that year, my team won the national first prize in the final contest. Here I post those problems for the sake of collection and sharing.

## Authors

- Wenhao Qiu (邱文昊)
- Yiyu Zhuang (庄义昱)

Qiu and Zhuang are brillant programmers while I am mainly responsible for model building and paper wirting, though we did not divide our work overly seperate.

## Contents
1. Searching for an optimal path in a web with both fixed and mobile speed-measuring radars.
2. Establishment of a seismic data analysis platform.
3. Estimation of the minimum living standard based on governmental fiscal pressure, economic development, social gap and residents' expectations.
4. Route arrangement for a harbor, considering both capacity and revenue.
5. (final) A dynamic scheduling model of the rail guided vehicle.

As you can see, the problems above are mostly about optimization and prediction which are exactly what we are good at. For each problem/ project, I will post the problem description file, datasets (if any) and our solution. Codes are attached to the end of solutions (in text), but I may share some codes files for optimation problems.
